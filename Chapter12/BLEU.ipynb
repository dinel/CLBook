    "# Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score (BLEU)\n",

    "In Section 12.5.2 of the book we presented the BLEU score. As we explained there, this is the most used automatic evaluation metric in machine translation. Despite being proposed in 2002, it is still employed by researchers who develop machine translation systems. The method was introduced in:\n",

    "## 1. Quick introduction to BLEU\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the BLEU score is to compare automatically the output of an MT engine to one or several human produced translations. The output of MT is referred to as *hypothesis*, whilst the human translations are referred to as *references*. As we already know, there is more than one correct translation for a given source sentence. For this reason, it is not possible to have a word by word comparison between the hypothesis and the references. Instead the BLEU score relies on a modified precision metric to calculate the overlap in terms of ngrams between the hypothesis and references.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, BLEU is calculated using ngrams of length from 1 to 4. This is referred to as BLEU-4. A weighting is assigned to each type of ngram, but usually an uniform distribution is used, where the weighting is 1/n. Given the way the score is calculated, it does not try to estimate the fluency or grammatical correctness of a translation directly. However, it was noted that unigram and bigram scores will largely capture the fidelity of the translation, whilst longer n-gram scores will account for fluency. \n",
    "\n",
    "The BLEU score is calculated using two parts:\n",
    "- the modified precision of ngrams from hypothesis in references, discussed in Section 3.1\n",
    "- brevity penalty (BP) which penalises translations which are significantly shorter than the references. This is discussed in Section 3.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BLEU score is calculated as geometric mean over the test corpus’ modified precision scores multiplied by the brevity penalty factor. The formula used is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$BLEU = BP \\cdot \\exp (\\sum_{n=1}^{N}{w_n\\log p_n} )$\n",
    "\n",
    "In most of the cases, it is not necessary to know the formula to calculate the score because there are several software packages which can do that for you. We will start by showing how the BLEU score can be calculated using NLTK.\n",

This method takes a number of parameters, but we will discuss here only the first three ``references``, ``hypothesis``, and ``weights``. For the rest of the parameters the default values are a good starting point in most of the cases.\n",
    "- the ``references`` parameter is a list of lists which contains the reference translation(s). Each inner list contains the tokens of one of the reference translations. In the example where we use only the first reference, the value of this parameter is ``[ref_a]``. If we use both references the value for this parameter will be ``[ref_a, ref_b]``. Please note that even if we provide only one reference, we still need to have a list of lists even though the outer list contains only one element. \n",
    "- the ``hypothesis`` parameter is a list which contains the tokens of the hypothesis. In the examples below we use the ``hyp`` variable.\n",
    "- the ``weights`` parameter indicates the weights that is given to unigrams, bigrams and so on. The default behaviour of the implementation is to calculate the BLUE score for up to 4-grams using uniform weights (i.e. ``(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25)``). This BLEU score is sometimes called BLEU-4. If there is no match of ngrams for a given n (e.g. 3-grams and above), the BLEU score is zero. It is possible to use a smoothing function to avoid this, but we will not discuss it here. This smoothing function is one of the additional parameters which we do not discuss here. However, interested readers can find more details in the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.translate.html#module-nltk.translate.bleu_score\" target=\"_blank\">NLTK documentation</a>. If we want to calculate BLEU score up to 5-grams, we provide 5 values in the tuple. For uniform weights we would have ``(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2)``. At the same time, if we want to use only unigrams, as in the examples discussed in the book, we can have a tuple with only one element (i.e. ``(1,)`` - keep in mind that the ``,`` is essential here because we have a tuple with only one element). For most of the discussion below, we will use unigrams. \n",

In this particular case the best score is obtained when we use the first reference and there is no change of that score when we use both references. We will discuss this in the next section."

    "\n",
    "The BLUE score is a precision-based metric. This means that it checks how many of the ngrams from the hypothesis are present in the reference. However, we cannot use the normal precision because the metric would be easily fooled. For example, for the hypothesis we have above the normal precision is 1 because every unigram from the hypothesis appears in the reference(s). For this reason, the BLEU score uses a modified precision which counts the maximum number of times an ngram appears in each of the references. This maximum number of times is used to limit the number of matches allowed. For example for Reference 1 we can count only two *the*s, which means that the precision score is 2/7. Note that we divide by the number of ngrams in the hypothesis, not reference. The reference is used only to determine the maximum number of matches.\n",

Most of the critism is directed towards the fact that the comparison between the hypothesis and references is made at token level. This means that a mismatch of a function word is treated exactly the same way as a difference in a content word. In addition, BLEU does not take into consideration the sentence structure which can lead to strange situations when there is a match in the ngrams, but they serve completely different syntactic roles. In this section, we show a few examples to make the reader aware of the limitations of BLEU."
